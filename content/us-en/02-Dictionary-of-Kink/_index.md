## General Terms

_Service (Role)_ or _Service-Type_  
Any individual that takes on a role (top/bottom, dom/sub, etc.) for the benefit of another.

**Note:** Motivations for being a Service-Type varies between individuals, although general consensus is that they find enjoyment in being able to provide the service, and not directly from the act itself.

### Kink Relationship Dynamics

_Power Exchange_  
Negotiated power imbalance, sometimes referred to as Authority Transfer.

_Top_  
An individual that gives sensation during kinky play.

_Bottom_  
An individual that receives sensation during kinky play.

_Dominant_  
An individual that receives control and/or authority over another individual.

_Submissive_  
An individual that gives control and/or authority over to another individual

### Safety Acronyms

_SCC_ \-- Safe, Sane, Consensual  
**Note:** Currently considered to be deprecated, even by its originator (David Stein), because the phrase has become overly diluted. Some folks would even pose the joke: "Safe, Sane, Consensual; pick two." as a way of hinting that kink-play always carries some form of risk, and cannot (generally), embody all three statements simultaneously. It is also important to note that consent is considered to be a hard requirement at all times.

_RACK \--_ Risk Aware Consensual Kink (Coined by Gary Switch, 1999\)  
**Note:** Currently considered to be the most appropriate acronym for kink safety as it reminds participants that they need to be aware of the risks for the activities they choose to participate in.

_PRICK \-- Personal Responsibility Informed Kink_  
**Note**: A lesser known acronym, but one that reinforces the idea that kink participants are ultimately responsible for their own safety.
