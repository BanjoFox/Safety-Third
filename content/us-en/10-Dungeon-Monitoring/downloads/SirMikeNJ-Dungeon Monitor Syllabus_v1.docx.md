Roles of the DM

1. Safety patrol – as the DM you are responsible for the safety of all the attendees and well as protecting the space.

   Safety means you are protecting both the mental and physical well being of the attendees. You do this by learning the basics of various forms of play. For example needle play might not be your jam but knowing that leaving uncapped needles around is a safety hazard. Today you will learn a little bit about the most common types of play.

   Protecting someone’s mental well being may involve stopping a scene that they want out of, settling a disagreement between attendees or doing something as simple as chatting with someone to tell them you were impressed with their scene (in the right time and context).

   You are also protecting the space both for the venue owners and the participants. An example is someone who wants to modify a piece of equipment that may lead to unsafe conditions. Another example is notifying folks about a spill that has caused a slippery floor.

2. You are the information center…people will ask you “where is \[blank\]?”, and you should be able to tell them or direct them to someone who can tell them.  
3. Emergency manager- in the event of an emergency evacuation you are responsible for making sure everyone knows where the exits are and where the gathering point is.  
   1. If emergency services are coming into the space it is up to the DM to notify everyone that they are coming and to get dressed and put their toys away.  
4. Peacekeeper – the DM may be needed to settle disputes of who gets to use equipment or if someone has been using equipment for too long to encourage them to finish up. Most venues use about 90 mins for most scenes although that can vary widely from venue to venue and play to play. Rope tends to take much longer than an impact scene, generally.  
5. Eyes and ears of the venue owner. Here you need to be familiar with the venue's rules and TOU. For example many venues forbid photos. Some do not allow food in the dungeon.  
6. Relayer of information to the relief DM and or the venue owner. Talk to them about people who are questionable or scenes that may have you uncomfortable.  
7. Etiquette manager – dungeon etiquette is relatively standard.  
   1. Clean your equipment after use.  
   2. Move your toys out of the way for the next person.  
   3. Toy bags should not block walk ways or doors.  
   4. Volume control (voice and music)  
   5. Their scene should not roll into someone else’s.  
8. Crowd control – a really hot scene can draw a crowd of people. The DM may have to encourage them to leave the players some space and refrain from comments and jumping in.  
9. Monitor after care areas  
   1. Typically, a quiet area where people can connect or come down with a soft place to land.  
   2. Some places allow sex.  
   3. Volume control   
10. Health and safety of attendees  
    1. Hydration  
    2. Food  
    3. Underlying health issues  
    4. Under the influence

    		

    

    

    

    

    Consent

    

    As a community we love acronyms:

    

    SSC – Safe sane and consensual

    RACK- Risk aware consensual kink

    PRICK – Personal Responsibility informed consensual kink

    

    Consent means an enthusiastic yes from both the top and bottom.

    Consent cannot be changed mid scene

    People under the influence cannot give consent

    

    Some scenes may have the appearance of being non consensual but it is likely just part of the scene.  An example is “Help me someone save me”

    “No not that”  “No I don’t want to” etc.

    

    All scenes must have a safeword system in place for both the top and bottom.

    It is strongly suggested that events use a standard safeword system that the DM’s know.

    

    What is a DM to do:

    You see a scene being planned where one participant does not look happy?

    What does the DM do?

    

    You see a scene where the bottom does not look like they want to be there. What does the DM do? 

    

    You see a scene where someone is inviting someone else into the scene? What does the DM do?

    

    You see someone calling red but the top is not stopping. What do you do?

    Interventions and diplomacy

    

    The DM’s role is akin to being a diplomat. 

    How to intervene?

    

1.  Making your presence known is a deterrent for most misbehaviors.   
2. Stopping to watch a scene for an extended period of time will frequently clue in participants.  
3. A quick flash of the flashlight can also make your presence known.  
4. Direct verbal intervention is rarely needed.  
5. Grab a witness and/ or a moderator on duty.  
6. Be discrete until you can’t be

   Let’s practice a bit

   

   Scenario 1:

   Scene negotiation and the bottom doesn’t want to do something.

   

   Scenario 2

   A scene in progress and the bottom does not want to be there.

   

   Scenario 3 

   Inviting someone else into the scene

   

   Scenario 4

   Red called but not stopping

   

   

   

   

   

   

   Equipment issues and position

   

1. The DM should inspect all the equipment in the play space looking for:  
   1. Where is the equipment located….is there enough space? A good rule of thumb is that there should be enough space to go completely around an equipment station plus double the length of the type of toys that are likely to be used at the station.  
   2. Make sure people are aware to check in with the DM and/or the venue's owner/operator before moving equipment. This should also be conveyed to the relief DM.  
      1. If equipment is moved the DM should give it a quick check to make sure it is in good condition and perhaps move it back to where it originated.   
   3. Each piece of equipment should be checked for:  
      1. Screws and bolts are secure.  
      2. Padding is not torn.  
      3. Wood is smooth and sealed with no stains/splinters or cracks.  
      4. The item is stable and weight bearing.  
2. There is a problem with the equipment…what do I do?  
   1. Fix it….loose bolts and nuts can be easily tightened.  
   2. Notify the venue owner.  
   3. If the item is unsafe for use, move it out of the way and place a note on it.  
   4. Keep an eye on it during the event.

Bystander intervention

	On occasion a bystander may intervene in a scene. In the event this occurs:

1. Call for assistance from another DM or the owners  
2. Typically, the top will be irritated and irate and the bottom will be upset or irate.  
3. Separate the bystander from the scene and get all the details.  
4. If the scene warrants being stopped, call the scene.  
5. If the determination is made that the scene can continue, ask the bystander to move away reassuring them that the DM’s will monitor the scene.  
6. Refer the parties involved to the owner for determination.

How to observe without being intrusive

1. Be quiet. Keeping radio volumes on low and phones on silent.  
   2. Minimize conversation and avoid conversations with the scene participants unless absolutely critical.   
   3. Observe from a distance but close enough that you can still see.  
   4. Keep moving…there are other scenes to keep an eye on.  
   5. Make sure you have introduced yourself before the scene begins. If you are interested in the scene wait until after care is completed.  
   6. If it is a darkened area use the flashlight as little as possible.

   

7. Someone playing under the influence:  
   1. Playing under the influence was very common in the 70’s and early 80’s when dungeons were often located in the basement of bars.  
      2. Dangers: 	  
         1. Loss of control…aim can be off completely  
         2. Loss of sensation means that someone cannot say when something is too much.  
         3. Unable to maintain an adequate airway.  
         4. Unable to react in an emergency.  
      3. Signs and symptoms:  
         1. Odor  
         2. Slurred speech  
         3. Glassy blood shot eyes  
         4. Uncoordinated motor functions  
         5. Mood swings   
              
            What to do: Call for assistance  
            Stop a scene  
            Engage in calm conversation  
            Let the group owner decide.  
            Some venues have a breathalyzer.  
            Marijuana can be ingested (edibles/gummies) smoked or vaped. It can be extremely difficult to identify. Use the guide above.  
              
            A good rule of thumb is that if they look uncoordinated or disoriented they should not be playing.  
            

Aftercare. The DM’s role.

	Aftercare looks different for everyone. Most spaces have a designated aftercare area. 

	For some after care is a snack and snuggles.

	Blankets and/ or stuffies.

	Sex

	Socializing.

The role of the DM is not to judge aftercare but to ensure it is falling within the guidelines of the house rules and is consensual.

1. Is it consensual?   
2. Are the following basic etiquette (see above).  
3. Are they being disruptive to others?  
4. The aftercare area is the area where the least amount of DM work is located yet the occasional problem tends to be a big problem.

Sex positive scenes:

1. Are they consensual?  
2. Are the proper barriers being used to protect the furniture?  
3. Are they in the correct location of the facility?  
4. Are male and female condoms available?  
5. When they are done is the area cleaned up?

Dungeon diplomacy:

The role of the DM is not to correct or instruct in a scene but to ensure that no one gets hurt and nothing gets damaged.

Some common disputes that occur:

1. I was waiting to use that piece of equipment.  
2. They are in the way of my scene.  
3. They are making too much noise  
4. Why can’t I….?  
5. I know what I am doing…leave me alone.  
6. Partner disputes.

Separate the parties and get one story at a time.

Low and steady voice. Raising your voice escalates the situation.

Do not make promises or agree with either party. Remaining impartial increases the perception of your authority.

Call for a mod on duty.

Use common sense.

Setting the scene for the DM.

1.Before dungeon opens the DM and the mod on duty should:

1. Familiarize themselves with the layout even if they have been there many times. Things change.  
   2. Check equipment and supplies.  
   3. Discuss the plans for the event such as sex positive, number of attendees, start and end times etc.  
   4. Discuss any concerns.  
   5. Clearly identify staff and roles and time tables.

Scenes

What to look for and be aware of:

      1. Is there enough room for the item being used…if not can room be made?  
      2. Is the item being used likely to cause serious injury or death (sledge hammer)?   
      3. Is the bottom in obvious distress that is above scene level?  
      4. Are parts of the body being impacted that are not safe for the implement? Ie: Whips to the throat…paddles to the head.  
      5. Is the bottom obviously injured?  
2. Bondage  
   1. Bondage is defined as causing a person to temporarily lose the ability to move or speak independently of the top?

      2. Is the bondage involving the neck? Is it attached to a fixed point?  
      3. If the person has a fall, is there adequate padding (mats etc).  
      4. Look at the extremities for signs of a blueish tint (note that some bondage can cause a temporary bluing of the skin and still be safe.

         4. Adequate life and safety standards need to be adhered to.

   The DM is the eyes and ears of the venue owner. Proper lighting where appropriate, visible fire exits and a clear emergency plan should all be known to the DM. Take the time to review the plans with your venue owner.

   

   

   

   

   

   Basic first aid:

1. Blood borne pathogens protection. Gloves at the least.  
2. Most common issues a DM will encounter will be:  
   1. Minor cuts –   
      1. Control the bleeding by using a clean dry cloth and putting pressure on it.   
      2. Have it cleaned off (soap and water works)  
      3. Usually a band aid will suffice.  
   2. Major bleeding –   
      1. Direct pressure (it bleeds through add another one on top of it.  
      2.  Elevate the extremity  
      3. Tourniquet as needed.  
      4.  If it needs a tourniquet it needs 911\.  
   3. Spurting blood – 

      i. Same as above but immediately call 911\. 

   d. Rope burn-

      i. usually being washed off to clean. OTC creams to soothe the burn (Vaseline, A+D etc)

      e. Twisted ankles –

      i. take the weight off, elevate, ice. If still not weight 	bearing go to urgent care or the ER

   6. Minor burns –   
      1. cool water not cold  
      2.  OTC creams as needed for minor pain relief.   
      3. If blistered do not pop blisters.   
   7. Chemical irritants \-    
      1. Flush with lots of cool water.  
      2.  Read the label.   
      3. Dawn dish detergent works wonders to help bind with most irritants.  
   8. Asthma attacks –   
      1. Sit down.   
      2. Loosen anything restrictive around the chest and abdomen.  
      3.  Assist with meds.

      2. Lay them down  
      3. Make sure they are breathing  
      4. Loosen any tight clothing.

       6. Press down hard and fast.  
       7. When tired (about 2 mins) switch.

Someone asks for help…now what?

1. Evaluate the request  
   1. If it is participating in a scene, politely decline.  
   2. If someone needs assistance or does not feel safe   
      1. Ask them if they want to speak privately but remain in view of non participants.  
      2. If they feel unsafe or want to complain about something that has happened to them, call for a MOD.  
      3. If they are expressing concern about someone else’s scene, thank them and let them know you will look at it.  
      4. Noise, light, smell (except for gas or burning) complaints are the same as above.  
      5. Maintain confidentiality. Notifying the MOD or owner does not break confidentiality.   
      6. If some one reports a sexual assault notify the MOD, venue owner, and the police. 

The DM tool box:

1. High visibility vest  
2. Visibility light  
3. Flashlight  
4. Shears  
5. Bandaids and gauze pads  
6. Handcuff key  
7. Latex gloves  
8. Work gloves  
9. Leatherman type tool  
   Venue supplies  
   1. Bolt cutters  
      2. Tools for equipment (ratchets, wrenches, screw drivers etc)  
         3. Duct tape  
         4. Fire extinguishers (check dates and pressure) and blankets.   
         5. First aid kits  
         6. Cleaning supplies

If the police show up:

1. Expected:  
1. Let everyone know that the police are coming and to get dressed and put the toys away.  
2. Unexpected:  
1. Only the owner should let them in.  
2. Instruct anyone who opens the door to tell the police you are getting the owner and close the door firmly. This creates a seal that the law upholds that the police can not breach unless there is evidence of an imminent life threat or evidence disposal.  
3. The owner should step outside to speak to them while the DM or a designated person alerts everyone to get dressed and put the toys away.  
4. When the police come in, a great phrase is that you are “creating artistic scenes.”  
5. Be polite and courteous to the police…mistreating them guarantees they will come back looking for an issue.
