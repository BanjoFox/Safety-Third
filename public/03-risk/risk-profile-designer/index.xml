    <title>Risk Profile Designer :: Safety Third</title>
    <link>http://localhost:1313/03-risk/risk-profile-designer/index.html</link>
    <description>Instructions Author’s Note!&#xA;This form was originally intended to be used in conjunction with my dungeon safety, and etiquette class “Safety Third!”. It is also possible to use as a standalone document for evaluating and tracking your own Risk Aware Consensual Kink (RACK).&#xA;About this form:&#xA;This is not meant to be a “Wishlist” or “Outcomes I want checklist! This is meant to serve as examples of what could happen during different types of kink scenes/play. Let me reiterate: All forms of play have some level of risk to the participants. What you accept is up to you.</description>
