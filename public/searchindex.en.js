It is also important to note that consent is considered to be a hard requirement at all times.\nRACK -- Risk Aware Consensual Kink (Coined by Gary Switch, 1999)\nNote: Currently considered to be the most appropriate acronym for kink safety as it reminds participants that they need to be aware of the risks for the activities they choose to participate in.\nPRICK -- Personal Responsibility Informed Kink\nNote: A lesser known acronym, but one that reinforces the idea that kink participants are ultimately responsible for their own safety.",

    "content": "A Brief Dictionary of Risk With examples as it applies to the kink community Author’s Note!\nWhether or not we are aware of it, risk evaluation is something that we all do every day of our lives. As kink enthusiast, it is even more important to be consciously aware of the risks involved in the activities we undertake. This writing, while not meant to be a comprehensive guide, will hopefully provide you with the vocabulary to talk about risk in a meaningful way.\nAbout this Document:\nEach term below (save for RACK which is a term that long predates this document’s origins), includes Commentary from the author, and one or more Examples. All examples are in the form of paired statements. The Risk statement is a potential bad outcome, whereas the However statement is a potential positive outcome or reason why someone would participate in that activity.\nBegin Terminology Risk (As used in this document) Risk is exposure to the chance of injury or loss.\nCommentary:\nThose four words: exposure, chance, injury, loss are at the core of understanding risk.\nRisk Awareness Risk Awareness is to be knowledgeable about the chances of injury or loss for a given situation.\nCommentary:\nAs a kink participant, how much you know about the risks of a given scene is hugely important as that knowledge can be used to protect yourself against the possibility of the scene going badly.\nExamples:\nRisk: Improper use of a fur/faux-fur flogger, such as around the neck area, could lead to the bottom getting hit in the eyes.\nHowever: Proper use of a fur/faux-fur flogger has a very low chance of hurting someone, and can be used as a warm-up, or for sensory play\nRACK An acronym for “Risk Aware Consensual Kink”, which many, the document author included, feel is a more accurate term than the previous “Safe Sane Consensual”.\nReferences: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk-aware_consensual_kink\nRisk Tolerance | Acceptable Risk Risk Tolerance or Acceptable Risk is the maximum amount of risk that one is willing to accept or endure.\nCommentary:\nAll activities, even those outside of kink, have some risk involved. Weigh the reward against the chance of injury or loss. This sets the bar for risk tolerance/acceptance.\nExamples:\nRisk: Fire play has a moderate chance to cause severe burns. However: This type of play can also have a therapeutic or relaxing effect.\nRisk: Impact play has a chance to leave severe bruises or cause organ damage. However: The endorphin rush can be joyful or exhilarating.\nRisk Mitigation Risk Mitigation are the steps taken to reduce the chance of injury or loss.\nCommentary:\nKnowing what could go wrong, and taking steps to avoid those situations can transform a high-risk situation into one that is medium or low risk.\nExamples:\nRisk: Equipment used in rope suspension can catastrophically fail.\nHowever: Having sufficient padding underneath the participant can reduce the chances of the participant getting hurt.\nRisk: Not knowing how to use a single tail can lead to severe injuries such as bleeding, or loss of vision.\nHowever: Attending a class, and practicing on non-living targets, can reduce the chances of the participant getting hurt.\nPost Mortem (*BONUS POINTS*) Post Mortem is the act of examining a situation, and discussing what went wrong, and/or what went right.\nCommentary:\nKink scenes can and will go badly. The severity, and frequency are largely dependent on how well the above topics were communicated. Even if a scene has gone without issue, it is important to review what can be done differently to improve future interactions.\nExamples:\nRisk: During a well-negotiated scene the giver (top) uses language which is problematic for the recipient (bottom). The recipient decides to conclude the scene early. A few days later, the pair discuss what happened, and have chosen to revise their boundaries/limitations for future scenes.\nHowever: Several individuals have concluded a scene which all participants were able to enjoy without issues. During the aftercare, each participant shares their favorite interactions, and have decided to continue trying new things together in the future.\nAdditional Note from the Author:\nThe term “Post Mortem” was borrowed from the author’s own work experiences while participating in “incident handling” discussions, and felt like a fun addition despite the morbid/tragic phrasing.",

IMPORTANT NOTE !!\nThese are *SUGGESTIONS* and should not be taken as medical or legal advice.\nCommunicate any issues/concerns you have BEFORE initiating a scene/play, even if it seems trivial. All forms of play can be dangerous, being aware makes it safer.\nStrong Recommendations:\n- Use common sense!\n- Consult your doctor(s) regarding any medical conditions you may have. - Do your best to know your own limitations. - Check in with yourself regularly. Your health, interests and tastes will change over time.\nSECTION 1 Responses Heart Condition Avoid:\nElectrical/Violet wand play. Risks: Increased chances of triggering cardiac problems. All forms of electricity are\npotentially dangerous. Having any voltage run through your body/across your heart could potentially cause a serious medical issue.\nUse Caution:\nRough, or very active/energetic scenes Risks: Increased heart rate. Treat these types of play/scenes the same way you would treat forms of cardiovascular (cardio) exercise.\nSensitive/Delicate Skin Avoid\nSee Risks Use Caution:\nFireplay Play Piercing/Needles Impact Rope Risks: These types of play have higher chances of leaving marks or damaging your skin. Play piercing/needles especially could result in temporary/permanent scarring.\nInjury or Other Physical/Mental Restriction Avoid:\nInjury/Restriction Dependent Use Caution:\nInjury/Restriction Dependent Risks: Many forms of play may result in further damage to an existing injury. People that have some form of physical or mental restriction may experience new injuries/trauma\nif those restrictions are not properly communicated.\nMedical Implant/Device Avoid:\nElectrical/Violet Wand Use Caution:\nImplant/Device Dependant Risks: Any medical device/implant which is connected to the body can be severely\ndamaged during scenes/play involving electrical stimulation. People with\npacemakers or other heart-related equipment are especially at risk.\nOther forms of medical implants/devices may restrict the types of scenes/play depending on the implant/device.\nSkin Condition/Allergy Avoid:\nPlay Piercing/Needles Knife play/Sharps Blood play Use Caution:\nFireplay Rope Impact Risks: All types of scenes/play where skin is intentionally/accidentally punctured may result in serious infection or illness or other ailments. Needle and Blood play are considered VERY high risk, and should be negotiated as such.\nSECTION 2 Responses Rank 1: Do not want | Rank 10: Best thing Ever\nScratches Rank 1’s should Avoid: Needles Knife/Sharps Play Reasoning: These forms of play leave marks that will last for hours/days weeks. Rank 1’s should be careful with: Rope Impact Reasoning: Some types of rope (ex: jute, coconut) have a chance to be itchy or leave scratch marks. Likewise, some impact toys, such as single tail whips, may leave scratches. Cuts Rank 1’s should Avoid: Needles Reasoning: Needle play is intended to break skin. Rank 1’s should be careful with: Knife/Sharps Play Impact: Single Tails, Dragon Tails, and similar Reasoning: Knife/Sharps Play may result in cuts/skin being broken. Many whips that come to a point or have a single edge may break the skin. Bleeding Rank 1’s should Avoid: Needles/Play Piercing Reasoning: Needle play is intended to break skin. Rank 1’s should be careful with: Knife/Sharps Play Impact: Single Tails, Dragon Tails, and similar Reasoning: Knife/Sharps Play may result in cuts/skin being broken. Many whips that come to a point or have a single edge may break the skin. Bruising Rank 1’s should Avoid: Impact Takedowns/Roughhousing Reasoning: Impact, and other physically-involved forms of play will often leave bruises or other marks. Rank 1’s should be careful with: Rope Reasoning: Rope, especially rope suspension, carries the possibility to leave bruises where the ropes were wrapped/tied. Black Eye(s) Rank 1’s should Avoid: Takedowns/Roughhousing Reasoning: In this instance any form of takedown roughhousing, enthusiastic wrestling, or anything involving flailing limbs could result in facial injuries. Rank 1’s should be careful with: Impact Reasoning: Some toys when used around the shoulders run the risk of wrapping around and hitting parts of the face. Redness or Skin Irritation Rank 1’s should Avoid: Fire Play Electrical/Violet Want Needles Knife/Sharps Play Reasoning: These forms of play all involve contact with the skin, and could induce redness, irritation or worse. Many fire or violet wand tops will also apply lotions/ointments to cool the skin down afterward. Rank 1’s should be careful with: Rope Impact Reasoning: Some types of rope (ex: jute, coconut) have a chance to be itchy or leave scratch marks. Likewise, some impact toys, such as single tail whips, may leave scratches. Burns or Scars Rank 1’s should Avoid: Fire Play Electrical/Violet Wand Cell Popping Branding Reasoning: Fire Play is perhaps one of the fastest ways to get severe burns. Similarly, electricity is hot. Violet wands carry much less risk of burns but it is still greater than many other forms of play. Cell Popping, and Branding are included only because they are kinks where leaving burn marks/scars are the intended goal. Rank 1’s should be careful with: Needles Knife/Sharps Play Reasoning: Needles, Knifes, Sharps, and anything else that punctures the skin has a chance to leave scarring. SECTION 3 Responses Rank 1: Do not want | Rank 10: Best thing Ever\nSore Muscles/Joints Rank 1’s should Avoid: Impact Takedowns/Roughhousing Reasoning: As an impact bottom you are being hit with implements which may cause soreness. Impact tops may be sore from repetitive use of their implements. Takedowns and/or general roughhousing carry similar risk of soreness as daily exercise (depending upon overall health). Rank 1’s should be careful with: Bondage Mummification/Vacuum beds Reasoning: Extended periods of immobility may cause stiffness in muscles or joints. Internal Damage/Broken Bones Rank 1’s should Avoid: Extreme Impact Rope Suspension Reasoning: There are very few, generally practiced, kinks in which a participant may suffer from internal bleeding, organ damage, or even broken bones. However, the possibility still exists. Rank 1’s should be careful with: Impact Takedowns/Roughhousing Electrical/Violet Wand Reasoning: Impact, Takedowns/Roughhousing especially when neck, and lower-back/kidneys could be injured. Electrical and Violet Wand play involves electrical currents running through an individual, and carries the possibility of injury accordingly. Cognitive/Mental/Emotional Rank 1’s should Avoid: Humiliation Objectification Reasoning: These forms of play can be mentally or emotionally damaging to the parties involved. However it is also possible to negotiate a scene in which an individual wants to relive a trauma or be put into a cathartic emotional state. These types of scenes can be used as a tool for healing mental wounds, but need to be carefully negotiated. Rank 1’s should be careful with: Sensory Deprivation Reasoning: Sensory deprivation may be disorienting and/or include other side-effects.",
